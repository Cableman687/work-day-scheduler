# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

- The motivation to complete this challenge was to test my own skills gained in the most recent week of the coding bootcamp, including but not limited to; jQuery, Bootstrap Components, Bootstrap Utilities, Google Fonts, and DayJS.

- This project was built as a testing ground for my own retention of the aforementioned skills.

- This application allows the user to properly organise their 9am to 5pm working schedule, and save each event to be revisited at a later time upon completion or revision.

- Through building this application, I learnt that there are many programming skills outside of what we learn throughout the week, and that research and collaboration is critical in order to achieve the best outcome for any given project.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application, the user must choose a 1-hour slot to place their activity.

By clicking in the text box, the user may enter their scheduled activity by typing.

By clicking the 'Save' icon at the end of each row, the user is able to save their activity to that slot.

As each hour in the day is passed, the blocks representing past, present and future hours will be denoted by different colors relative to the current time.

## Testing

To experiment with the reactions of the colour of each Time-Block, open the script.js file and 'comment-out' line 10.
Un-Comment line 11, and update the held variable of '10' to a specified hour in the day to reflect that time period in 24-hour time. E.g. For 2pm, update this value to '14'.
